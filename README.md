Use of sockets to receive a string and recive the sorted string. Using server client socket method.
This was from my Distributed System Lab class.
C, Java and Python method to sort a string and send to client via TCP

How To Use:

Tested only in a Linux Terminal:
C:
- Open your terminal;
- for server 'Type' './server (PORT as your choice) &'
- './client localhost (PORT as your choice)' to connect the server;
- Type your string
- Voil√°.. the server will sort and send to you;
Java:
- Just excecute 'java TCPServer &' 
- and after 'java TCPClient 
- rinse and repeat the string input like C
Python3 
- 'python3 server.py &'
- 'python3 client.py'
- same as Java and C.
